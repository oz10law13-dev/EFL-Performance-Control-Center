## 0. WHAT THIS BLOCK IS (AND IS NOT)

### 0.1 Core Identity

**Elastic Reload is:**

- A **restoration + readiness block** for athletes exiting force-biased training, post-season recovery, or training interruptions
- A **bridge between developmental phases** without consuming specialization allocation
- An **elastic re-introduction protocol** emphasizing quality, rhythm, and deceleration competency over volume or intensity peaks
- **Court sport-specific** with emphasis on landing mechanics, ankle stiffness, and braking control

**Elastic Reload is NOT:**

- A specialization block (does NOT count toward annual limits)
- A peak performance block (no E3 dominance, no depth drops for height)
- A replacement for Foundations (requires prerequisite movement quality)
- An in-season maintenance protocol (use ICPs for that)
- A rehab or return-to-play protocol (route to R2P if injury present)


### 0.2 System Role

**Problem Solved:**
Athletes transitioning between blocks often face:

- Elastic detraining after force-dominant phases
- Movement quality regression during breaks
- CNS fatigue from consecutive high-intensity blocks
- Need for readiness restoration before specialization

**Solution Provided:**

- Low-to-moderate elastic exposure (E1-E2 dominant, E3 accent only)
- Deceleration skill emphasis (stick landings before rebound)
- Strength maintenance, not progression (DB-dominant, tempo)
- Athletic rhythm restoration (continuous movement quality, not chaotic)
- Tissue durability focus (tendon + joint tolerance via isometrics + eccentrics)

***

## 1. BLOCK CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL — LOCKED)

### 1.1 Specialization Status

**Classification:** **TRANSITION / RELOAD BLOCK (NON-SPECIALIZATION)**

**Does NOT count toward annual specialization limits per `EFL_MDP_COURT_VERTICAL_v1_4.json`**

**Rationale (System-Consistent):**

- No peak elastic exposure (E3 remains ≤30%, quality-limited)
- No max depth or reactive velocity emphasis
- No CNS overload (session density remains moderate)
- Intent = restoration + readiness, not adaptation peak
- Elastic volume ceiling lower than Elastic Specialization (160–200/week vs. 200–240/week)

**System Implication:**
✅ Athletes may complete **Elastic Reload + Elastic Specialization** in the same training year without violating youth protection rules.

**Containment Rule:**
If Elastic Reload volume or E-node distribution exceeds these thresholds, it **automatically reclassifies as Specialization** and consumes annual allocation.

***

## 2. ENTRY GATE CRITERIA (MANDATORY — NO BYPASS)

### 2.1 Eligible Entry Sources

Athlete must satisfy **at least ONE** of the following:


| Entry Source | Notes |
| :-- | :-- |
| Completed Foundations block | Any court sport, exit criteria passed |
| Completed Max Strength / Force block | ≥4 weeks force-biased training |
| Exited In-Season ICP (GREEN state) | Post-season clearance, no injury flags |
| Training interruption ≥3 weeks | Structured work paused, returning to training |

### 2.2 Readiness Requirements (Binary Checklist)

| Requirement | Standard | Bypass Allowed? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Readiness State | GREEN only | ❌ YELLOW = downgrade protocol, RED = quarantine |
| Pain (0–10 scale) | ≤2/10 active joint pain | ❌ >2/10 = R2P routing |
| Soreness | ≤3/10 at session start | ❌ >3/10 = Day C only or rest |
| Sleep | ≥6 hrs avg last 3 nights | ❌ <6 hrs = YELLOW override |
| Facility Access | Available 3×/week minimum | ❌ If blocked = OB-C Micro equivalent |

### 2.3 Movement Quality Gates (Coach-Assessed)

Athlete must demonstrate:

- ✅ **Controlled snap-down** (no knee valgus collapse, quiet landing)
- ✅ **Bilateral landing quality** (symmetrical, no audible slam)
- ✅ **Single-leg stick landing** (≥2 seconds hold, no wobble)

**If ANY gate fails:**
→ Route to **Foundations** (repeat Weeks 5–8) or **R2P** (if pain/mechanics breakdown present)

### 2.4 Exclusion Criteria (Do NOT Enter)

❌ **Elastic Reload is FORBIDDEN if:**

- Active tendinopathy flare (patellar, Achilles, rotator cuff)
- Unresolved landing faults (valgus collapse, asymmetry, trunk collapse)
- Currently in congested competition phase (≥2 games/week)
- Readiness RED or pain >2/10
- Athlete has not completed prerequisite block or equivalent exposure

***

## 3. POPULATION \& LOAD CEILINGS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 3.1 Youth 13–16 (LOCKED)

| Parameter | Ceiling | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| F–V Bias | BALANCED only | `EFL_Governance_v4.1`, youth lock |
| Weekly elastic contacts | ≤200 contacts | `Load_Standards_v2.2.0`, transition block |
| Session elastic contacts | ≤80 contacts | Youth hard cap, 3×/week structure |
| E3 exposure | ≤30% of elastic contacts | Reload accent limit (vs. 40% Specialization) |
| Band 3 max | ≤20% of WORK time | Elastic block constraint |
| Consecutive elastic days | FORBIDDEN | 48h rest required between Days A/B |

### 3.2 Youth 17+ / Adults

- **Same structure applies**
- Contact ceiling becomes **quality-limited**, not numeric
- E3 remains **accent only** (≤30%)
- Band 3 may increase to 25% WORK if force readiness confirmed


### 3.3 Day C Invariant (All Populations)

**Day C elastic contacts = 0 (ALWAYS)**

**Rationale:**
Day C exists to protect elastic quality on Days A/B by absorbing weekly fatigue without adding CNS or elastic load.

**Violation Consequence:**
If Day C includes elastic work → session is **INVALID** and must be rejected.

***

## 4. PRACTICE LOAD OVERRIDE MATRIX (AUTOMATIC)

### 4.1 External Load Integration

| External Load | Automatic Action | Reason Code |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ≤3 practices/week | Full program as written | Normal load, no override |
| 4 practices/week | ↓ Elastic contacts by 20–30% <br> Remove E3 entirely <br> Cap Band 3 at 10% | `HIGHLOADFLAG_PRACTICE` |
| ≥5 practices/week | Force 2 sessions/week only <br> Convert Day C → Recovery variant <br> No E3, E2 minimal | `QUARANTINE_PRACTICE_OVERLOAD` |
| Tournament week (≥3 games) | Day C only OR full quarantine <br> No elastic work | `TOURNAMENT_OVERRIDE` |

### 4.2 Game Proximity Rules (Court Sports)

**Pre-Game:**

- ≤48h before game: **No elastic work** (Day C or rest)
- ≤72h before game: **No rebound emphasis** (stick landings only, E1 max)

**Post-Game:**

- ≤48h after game: **No elastic work** (Day C recovery or rest)
- ≤72h after game: **No E3**, E2 light only if soreness ≤2/10

**Rationale:**
Court sport games = high elastic + decel load. Programmed elastic work compounds fatigue and injury risk.

## 5. WEEK-BY-WEEK PROGRESSION MATRIX (6 WEEKS)

### 5.1 Elastic (E-Node) Progression

| Week | E1% | E2% | E3% | Contacts/Session (2×/wk) | Contacts/Session (3×/wk) | Weekly Total | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | 50 | 35 | 15 | 60–70 | 60 | 120–180 | Elastic ramp-in, E2 dominant |
| 2 | 45 | 35 | 20 | 65–75 | 60 | 130–180 | Rhythm emphasis, E3 intro |
| 3 | 40 | 35 | 25 | 70–80 | 65 | 140–195 | Peak elastic (quality gate) |
| 4 | 40 | 35 | 25 | 70–80 | 65 | 140–195 | Hold peak, maintain quality |
| 5 | 50 | 35 | 15 | 60–70 | 60 | 120–180 | Taper begins |
| 6 | 60 | 30 | 10 | 50–60 | 50 | 100–150 | Exit deload, prep for routing |

**Global Rules:**

- If 3×/week: cap session contacts at **80 max** (youth weekly cap = 240)
- E3 **never exceeds 30%** (vs. 40% in Specialization)
- Week 3 = **quality gate**: if landing degrades, remove E3 and hold Week 2 distribution


### 5.2 Strength (Band) Progression (WORK Only)

| Week | Band 0–1% | Band 2% | Band 3% | Intent |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | 50 | 40 | 10 | Stiffness + movement quality |
| 2 | 45 | 40 | 15 | Peak elastic support |
| 3 | 45 | 35 | 20 | Max Band 3 allowed (reload) |
| 4 | 45 | 35 | 20 | Hold strength, elastic priority |
| 5 | 50 | 35 | 15 | Taper (if 6-week) |
| 6 | 55 | 30 | 15 | Exit deload |

**Band Intent Definitions:**

- **Band 0–1:** Movement quality, tempo, isometrics, tendon stiffness
- **Band 2:** Force transfer support, moderate load, long rest
- **Band 3:** Rate-only (2–4 reps, fast concentric, NO grinding)

**Forbidden:**

- Band 4 (youth hard ban)
- Band 3 grinding sets (slow tempo, AMRAP, fatigue-based)
- Bilateral axial dominance (elastic priority = stiffness + rate, not max force)

## 6. DAY ARCHITECTURE (ABC STRUCTURE — LOCKED)

### 6.1 Day A — Elastic + Landing

| Block | Time | Content | E-Node | Band | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| PRIME | 8–10 min | Ankle mobility, pogo iso, low hops | E1 | 0 | Prep elastic system |
| PREP | 8–10 min | Rhythm pogos, continuous | E1–E2 | 0 | Movement quality |
| WORK | 18–25 min | **Elastic block:** Box jump → stick, rebound jumps <br> **Strength:** Goblet squat (tempo), RFESS | E1–E3 | 0–3 | Elastic dominant |
| CLEAR | 5–8 min | Anti-extension, carries | None | 0 | Trunk + tissue |

**Weekly Progression:**

- Weeks 1–2: Teach quiet landings (stick > rebound)
- Weeks 3–4: Maintain rhythm (continuous contacts)
- Weeks 5–6: Confidence, not height (quality deload)


### 6.2 Day B — Braking + Strength

| Block | Time | Content | E-Node | Band | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| PRIME | 8–10 min | Hip mobility, glute activation | E0 | 0 | Prepare decel system |
| PREP | 8–10 min | Lateral shuffle, bounds (low) | E1 | 0 | Decel skill intro |
| WORK | 18–25 min | **Decel block:** Forward/lateral stops <br> **Eccentric:** Tempo split squat, DB RDL <br> **Bilateral:** Goblet/front squat | E0–E1 | 0–3 | Braking quality > load |
| CLEAR | 5–8 min | Anti-rotation, hip flexor stretch | None | 0 | Tissue care |

**Weekly Progression:**

- Weeks 1–2: Forward stop, tempo eccentric
- Weeks 3–4: Lateral stop, DB RDL tempo
- Weeks 5–6: Multi-angle stops, SL RDL


### 6.3 Day C — Rhythm + Resilience (0 ELASTIC)

| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| PRIME | 8–10 min | Breathing, joint prep | E0 | 0 | Parasympathetic focus |
| PREP | 8–10 min | Skips, marches, flow | E0 | 0 | Athletic rhythm (no CNS) |
| WORK | 18–25 min | **Tendon:** Calf iso, bent-knee calf <br> **Unilateral:** Step-downs, SL control <br> **Upper:** Push/pull balance <br> **Trunk:** Carries, reach | **0 contacts** | 0–1 | Durability only |
| CLEAR | 5–8 min | Mobility, stretch | None | 0 | Restoration |

**Weekly Progression:**

- Weeks 1–2: Calf iso, step-downs, carries
- Weeks 3–4: Bent-knee calf, lateral step-downs, carries + reach
- Weeks 5–6: Low-amplitude hops (E0 only, optional), flow carries

**Critical Rule:**
Day C **NEVER adds cumulative elastic fatigue**. This day should leave athletes feeling **better, not taxed**.

***

## 7. PATTERN GUARANTEES (WEEKLY MINIMUMS)

| Pattern | Min Touches/Week | Day Priority | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Unilateral knee | 2 (locked) | A, B, C | Valgus control, injury prevention |

| Push (horizontal/angled) | 1–2 | A, B, C | Submax, sport-specific constraints |
| Plyometrics | 2 (A + B only) | **A** (vertical), **B** (lateral/decel) | Day C = 0 contacts (enforced) |
| Deceleration mechanics | 2 | **B** (primary) | Braking quality, landing control |

**Violation Protocol:**
If any locked pattern is missing → session is **INVALID** and must be flagged with `PATTERN_LOCKED_MISSING`.

***

## 8. DOWNGRADE LOGIC (AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS)

### 8.1 Downgrade Triggers

| Trigger | Immediate Action | Reason Code |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Landing quality degrades (valgus, asymmetry) | Remove E3 → E2 only <br> ↓ Contacts by 20% <br> Add unilateral knee volume | `LANDING_QUALITY_FLAG` |
| Tendon soreness ↑ session-to-session | Remove elastic entirely <br> Day C only until soreness ≤2/10 | `TENDON_IRRITATION_FLAG` |
| Athlete reports "heavy legs" ≥2 sessions | Convert Day A → Day C variant <br> No elastic for 7 days | `CNS_FATIGUE_FLAG` |
| Soreness ≥3/10 at session start | Hold elastic volume (no progression) <br> Apply E2 re-lock if E3 present | `SORENESS_FLAG` |
| Practice load spikes (≥5×/week) | Apply Practice Override Matrix (Section 4.1) | `HIGHLOADFLAG_PRACTICE` |

### 8.2 Downgrade Escalation

**If downgrade persists ≥2 weeks:**
→ Exit block immediately
→ Route to **Foundations** (repeat Weeks 5–8) or **R2P** (if pain/mechanics breakdown)

**Reason Code:** `PERSISTENT_DOWNGRADE_EXIT`

***

## 9. EXIT CRITERIA (QUALITY-BASED, NOT TIME-BASED)

### 9.1 Exit Readiness Checklist

Athlete exits Elastic Reload when **ALL of the following are true:**


| Criterion | Standard | Assessment Method |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Landing mechanics | Clean under fatigue, no valgus/asymmetry | Coach visual assessment |
| Elastic work perception | Feels easier, not harder (RPE ↓ for same volume) | Athlete report |
| Cumulative soreness | No increase week-to-week, ≤2/10 baseline | Daily check-in |
| Bounce + confidence | Athlete reports improved spring, readiness for intensity | Subjective + objective (CMJ optional) |
| Total elastic contacts | ≥400 cumulative across 6 weeks | Session log tracking |
| Decel mechanics | Competent controlled stops, no valgus | Coach assessment |

**If ANY criterion fails at Week 6:**
→ Extend to Week 7 or 8 (max)
→ If still fails, route to **Foundations** or **R2P**

***

## 10. EXIT ROUTING (DETERMINISTIC PATHS)

### 10.1 Routing Decision Matrix

| Athlete State | Route To | Rationale |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Needs peak elastic, quality confirmed | **Elastic Specialization** | Reload completed, ready for high-intensity block |
| Season approaching (≤4 weeks) | **In-Season ICP** | Taper into competition, maintenance mode |
| Force deficit present, quality good | **Max Strength / Force Block** | Reload → force emphasis valid sequence |
| Quality degraded, persistent soreness | **Foundations** (repeat Weeks 5–8) | Rebuild landing quality + E-node tolerance |
| Recreational / adult, no competition | **Durability Engine** or **MicroLabs** | General fitness, movement quality maintenance |
| Pain or injury flags present | **R2P Project** | Clinical handoff required |

### 10.2 Routing to Elastic Specialization (Entry Gate)

**Athlete may route to Elastic Specialization if:**

- ✅ Elastic Reload exit criteria passed (Section 9.1)
- ✅ Landing quality ≥7/10 (coach-assessed)
- ✅ No joint irritation or tendon soreness
- ✅ Readiness GREEN for ≥2 weeks
- ✅ Season allows ≥6 weeks before competition

**If conditions NOT met:**
→ Route to **In-Season ICP** or extend **Elastic Reload** to Week 7–8

***

## 11. SYSTEM INTEGRATION POINTS

### 11.1 MDP — Court Vertical (`EFL_MDP_COURT_VERTICAL_v1_4.json`)

**Add Elastic Reload as:**

- **Reload / Transition Block** between Foundations ↔ Elastic Specialization
- **Non-Specialization classification** (does not count toward annual limits)
- **Legal seasons:** OFFSEASON only (PRESEASON if ≥8 weeks to competition)
- **Entry requirements:** Foundations exit OR force-block exit OR post-season GREEN


### 11.2 Sport Demands Grid (`sport_demands_grid_v2.2.2.json`)

**Tag Elastic Reload as:**

- **Elastic demand:** MODERATE (vs. HIGH in Specialization)
- **Deceleration demand:** MODERATE
- **CNS load:** LOW–MODERATE
- **Fatigue accumulation:** LOW
- **Weekly plyo volume:** 120–200 contacts (vs. 200–240 Specialization)


### 11.3 Foundations \& Elastic Specialization Blocks

**Elastic Reload becomes:**

- Legal bridge between **Foundations → Elastic Specialization**
- Legal re-entry protocol after **In-Season → Off-Season**
- Legal reload after **Max Strength → Elastic emphasis**

**No violation of earned exposure rules** (Foundations E2 tolerance prerequisite still required)

### 11.4 BridgeAthletic Tagging

**Program Tags:**

- `Elastic Reload`
- `Deceleration`
- `Athletic Movement`
- `Joint-Friendly`
- `Court Sport Support`

**Day Tags:**

- **Day A:** `Elastic / Landing`
- **Day B:** `Braking / Strength`
- **Day C:** `Rhythm / Durability`

***

## 12. PROGRESSION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Status | Rationale |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Jump quality gates height | ENFORCED | Quality > quantity in reload context |
| Stick landings before rebound | ENFORCED | Decel competency prerequisite |
| If soreness ↑ → reduce contacts, not strength | ENFORCED | Elastic sensitive to volume, strength supportive |
| No day stacks vertical + lateral plyos | ENFORCED | CNS protection, pattern quality |
| Athletes should feel springier, not crushed | ENFORCED | Reload intent = readiness, not fatigue |


***

## 13. PRODUCT POSITIONING (COMMERCIAL SUMMARY)

### 13.1 What It Replaces

**Nothing.**

Elastic Reload does not replace any existing block. It fills a **system gap** between developmental and peak phases.

### 13.2 What It Supports

**Everything after it.**

- Prepares athletes for **Elastic Specialization** without consuming specialization allocation
- Restores elastic quality after **force-dominant phases** (max strength, hypertrophy)
- Provides **re-entry protocol** post-season or post-break
- Bridges **Foundations → Peak blocks** with lower CNS cost


### 13.3 Best Used

- **Before speed blocks, power blocks, or heavy off-season lifts**
- **After max strength cycles** (restore elastic quality)
- **Post-season re-entry** (when ICP ends, before Foundations)
- **Mid-year reload** (accumulated fatigue, need for quality restoration)

***

## 14. VERSION CONTROL

**v1.0** | 2026-01-07
**Status:** OPERATIONAL
**Changes from concept:**

- Formalized entry gates, exit criteria, routing logic
- Declared non-specialization classification
- Integrated practice override matrix
- Defined population ceilings, band/E-node progressions
